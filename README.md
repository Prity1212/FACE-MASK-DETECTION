# FACE-MASK-DETECTION
Face mask detection plays an important role for reducing the spread of covid-19 virus. Here, we proposed approach of face mask detection which is mainly based on machine learning and deep learning. The dataset which is used in this paper is collected from GitHub. The dataset was prepared by Prajna Bhandary and it contains total 1376 images in which 690 images is available with mask and 686 images is available without mask. The techniques which is used in it, gives us the accuracy of 98.24% and it gives the quick result. Through this model, our goal is identified whether a person in image is wearing a face mask or not.
